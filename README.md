 # linear-equation 
 The main purpose of this project is to analyze 3 methods (direct Gaus's method, iterative Jacobi's method, and iterative Gauss-Seidel's method) of solving linear equations with thousands of unknowns. 
 In this project I used the project build system called Ceedling. 
 Ceedling was mostly used to provide tests using the C test framework "Unity". 
 To build the main app: 

     cd src 
     mkdir build 
     cd build 
     cmake ../ -B .
     cmake --build . 

 program executable will be created in the build folder and named "lin_eq".
